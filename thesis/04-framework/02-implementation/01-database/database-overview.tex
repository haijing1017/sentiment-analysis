\subsection{Database overview\label{sec:database-overview}}
All the data acquired or generated is stored in a single relational database called \inlinecode{sentiment\_db}. 
The logical view of the database is shown in Figure \ref{fig:db-schema}. 
In favor of clarity, parts considered inconsequential to sentiment analysis processes are not disclosed. 
Those include, but are not limited to: django sessions, brands etc.
\input{\DatabaseOverviewPath/diagrams/db-schema.tex}

As previously stated, we have extended and built our framework on top of a preexisting relational MySQL database schema which came with a set of specifications that were adopted and applied to \inlinecode{sentiment\_db}.
Using a version of MySQL greater or equal to 5.5.3 was a hard constraint because in that release MySQL introduced support for \inlinecode{uft8mb4} encoding.  
As opposed to \inlinecode{uft8}'s three bytes per character maximum, 
\inlinecode{uft8mb4} uses a maximum of four bytes per character making it fully compatible with \inlinecode{uft8} and, most importantly, able to correctly encode and store emojis.
It is worth mentioning that only two data tables that were a part of the original database were used in analysis and those are \inlinecode{im\_commento} and \inlinecode{im\_post}.

For the sake of completeness, following tables contain details and field descriptions of used data tables.

As mentioned, emojis play a big role in determining sentiment of a comment. 
Since none of the APIs took them into account, we used sentiment scores from \emph{Emoji Sentiment Ranking}\footnote{http://kt.ijs.si/data/Emoji\_sentiment\_ranking} published as a part of a sentiment analysis study\cite{Kralj2015emojis},  and imported them into the database table \inlinecode{im\_emoji\_stats} whose details are shown in Table \ref{tab:im-emoji-stats}.  
However, not all emojis or emoticons that occurred in our data set were included in the study (e.g. 📘 🍾 🙂 🙄 🕶 :) :D ).
Which means they had to be manually inserted in the db. 
Their sentiment scores were determined by finding a similarly defined emoji and making the assumption that they had the same, or at least similar, sentiment. 
%All emojis that were inserted by hand are marked by a true value in  \inlinecode{is\_determined\_by\_hand} column.
For example, green book's (📗) sentiment score was used in place for the missing blue book emoji (📘). 
An example of missing inserted emojis and their similar counterparts can be found in Table \ref{tab:inserted-emoticons}

To keep Tables \ref{tab:im-commento-sentiment}, \ref{tab:im-post-sentiment}, \ref{tab:im-commento-sentiment} and \ref{tab:im-sentiment-api-stats} concise we've bundled descriptions of all \inlinecode{sentimen\_api} columns together. 
Each of those columns contain sentiment predictions of a specific API used. 
The $(column, API)$ mappings can be found in table below.
\input{\DatabaseOverviewPath/tables/column-api-mappings.tex}

Also, the columns in subsequent tables for which the data type is set to \inlinecode{LONGTEXT}- default to a JSON string. 
Storing multi-value JSON strings might seem to go against the First Normal Form (1NF) rule which asserts that every column should hold a single value.
However, MySQL 5.7. has introduced support for JSON. 
And one of its features is normalization of JSON documents prior to inserting \cite{MySQLjson}.
Even though we opted for a version without JSON support, we've decided to code for future compatibility in order to avoid database bloat caused by an exaggerated number of columns. 
This way instead of having multiple columns for each $(API, language)$ configuration, we have only one.
