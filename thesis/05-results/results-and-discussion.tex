The calculated metrics discussed in Section \ref{sec:experimental-setting} can be found in their entirety in Tables  \ref{tab:precision-all-results}, \ref{tab:recall-all-results} and \ref{tab:accuracy-all-results}.
However, the data in a table format is a bit dense and presents a challenge to anyone who wants to gain valuable insights from it. 
To help with the visualization data were also presented in form of a few bar charts. The first two showing accuracy across all APIs, and the rest displaying precision and recall for Text-processing API.

If we take a closer look at the accuracy charts we can immediately see that predictions which used English translations had higher accuracy over the predictions made using content in original language. 
In fact, the accuracy was improved by 11.34\% on average across all APIs used.

Taking comments marked as spam out of the equation does improve overall accuracy but by a very small margin of 1\%. 
One of the reasons for such small improvement could be that the fraction of spam data was relatively low (6.02\%) and hence couldn't have a big impact on the metric.

However, the biggest impact on accuracy is gained by the usage of English translations containing emojis.
Accuracy of predicted sentiments of translated comments improved on average 19.39\% when emojis were taken into account. 
What is even more interesting to note is the fact that emoji sensitive sentiment predictions of comments in original language outperform English emoji-less predictions by 9\% w.r.t to accuracy.
Both of these numbers prove that we were correct in assuming that emojis were a very important factor when it comes to determining content sentiment.

All APIs had improved their accuracy to be above 60\% with the interventions our framework introduced. 
The interventions being translating comments and taking emojis into account. 
And out of all Text-processing API predicted sentiment of comments 74\% ofthe time.
That is great result indeed because when it comes to determining sentiment even humans can't do it 100\% accurately. 
Indeed, human accuracy tends to be around 80\%, meaning people tend to agree on sentiment only around 80\% of the time. 
This shines a different light on the results \cite{80PercentAccuracy}. 

Looking at the recall and precision bar charts of the Text-processing API 
we can see how both metrics improved with using English translations and emojis.
But the improvement is much more prominent with respect to recall and the positive label. 
Which means that the classifier managed to pick up a larger number of positive comments then originally.
On the other hand, it seems the API struggled with identifying the ones labeled negative.
As we can see from the charts, at best, Text-processing API picked up on 48\% of negative comments; meaning it misclassified more than half as either positive or neutral.
But we would need more data labeled negative (more than 10.89\% at least) in order for us to confidently conclude the API didn't perform well with respect to comments having negative sentiment.
