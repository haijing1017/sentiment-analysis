\newcommand*{\ResultsPath}{05-results}
In this chapter we show how the developed framework  allowed us to compare the performance of selected APIs (the ones described in Section \ref{sec:apis}). 
And in turn, the comparison allowed us to assess the validity of the framework.
This chapter also aims to indicate how the framework can easily be extended for assessment of other, additional APIs.
